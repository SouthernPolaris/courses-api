The focus will be on South Australia with the intent that what students learn in this environment will equip them with a protocols foundation for working with Indigenous peoples from elsewhere in Australia. An important learning outcome for students will be gaining knowledge on the intrinsic importance of country/land, the environment kin and identity for Indigenous people. Students may visit a key site on Kaurna country such as the cultural trail along the River Torrens. Students will also visit sites such as the South Australian Museum, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Mortlock Library or Tandanya Cultural Institute in order to assess, analyse and explore the differences and juxtaposition on how Indigenous Knowledges, relationships, cultures and people are represented by State institutions or Indigenous organisations. Indigenous elders, storytellers, performance and academics will teach students by providing knowledge of the Indigenous relationships and responsibilities that are intrinsic to successful communication and activities with Aboriginal people.
